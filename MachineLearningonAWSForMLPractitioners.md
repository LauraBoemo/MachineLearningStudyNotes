### Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning

Artificial Intelligence is a collection of various different technologies, different disciplines that comes together. The key work for AI is "mimic human intelligence".

Machine Learning is a subset of AI, it is about using machines to search for patterns in data, building logic models from a very large dataset. Apply statistics to solve business problems (can't solve using only "if" and "then" type of rules). 

Deep Learning is a subset of ML (a subset of AI), is an expansion of ML, solve problems that ML cant solve.

### Solving problem: Traditional programming or Machine Learning

In Traditional Programming you write the business rules, with Machine Learning, the data writes the business rules.

Use ML when...
1. You can't code it: complex tasks where deterministic solutions don't suffice (Eg., Recognizing speech/images);
2. When you can't scale it: replace repetitive tasks needing human-like expertise (E.g., recommendations, spam, fraud detection, machine translation);
3. When you have to adapt/personalize: E.g., recommendation  and personalization;
4. When you can't track it: E.g., automated driving;

    - 1950 to 1998 > Intense academic activity {
        <br>1986 > Backpropagation algoritm
        <br>1998 > Long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks<br>
    }
    <br>- 2998 to 2007 > Neural winter {
        <br>2007 > GPU training

### Types of Machine Learning

There are tree types...
1. Supervised learning
    <br>Similar how humans learn: Human intervention and validation required; <br>e.g., photo classification (input. e.g., photo of a dog) + tagging (label. e.g., "Labrador" label) = training data --> Machine Learning Algorithm --> Prediction ("Cat"). In this case, we compare our prediction with the label, cat = dog? So, cat is not equal as dog, and then we go back to our ML algorithm and adjust its model.<br><br>Two types of algorithms
    <br>1.1. Regression;<br>- E.g., estimating tag price<br>1.2. Classification;<br>- E.g., Disting in categories, bynary  and multyclass clasifications for ex.<br><br>
2. Unsupervised learning
    <br>When we don't have any label data. The ML Algorithm looks to the parameter (usually, it is a graphic) and then do predictions, which is placing things into specific groups. It is not comparable..<br><br>One type of algorithms
    <br>2.1. Grouping/Clustering
3. Reinforcement learning
    <br>Where you train an agent. The agent take actions inside and environment, it returns to the agent its states and rewards. Train robots to walk etc<br><br>One type of algorithms
    <br>3.1. Correct actions rewarded

### Key Machine Learning terminology and concepts
<br>Label/Target is a dependent variable that youre trying to predict
<br>Feature is a independent variable that helps you make predictions
<br>Feature Engineering is a data transformation, the process of reshaping data to get more value out of it
<br>Feature Selection is a variable/subset selection process of using the most valuable data
